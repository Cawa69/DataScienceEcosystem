# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 

# In[2]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3*4)+5
print(result)


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
